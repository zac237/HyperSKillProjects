# HyperSKillProjects
Projects made  for Java Hyperskill
I'm trying to learn how to use Github so that I can keep track of my journey in learning how to program. This repo and its title probably wont' make sense to me down the 
line once I understand the platform more, but I'm trying to post things and get an idea for how this functions.

This should contain one of my first projects, a "chat bot" made in Java from HyperSKill's Java beginner track project list.
